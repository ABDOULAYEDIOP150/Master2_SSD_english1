Hello everyone, my name is Abdoulaye Diop.

It's a pleasure to tell you about my journey as a Master 2 student in Data Science and Data Science. To get to know me better, here's an overview of my background and motivations.

# Background and Motivation:
I come from Senegal, a country rich in culture and history, located in West Africa. I started part of my studies there, which gave me a solid foundation in education. 

## Reason for choosing France: 

My decision to pursue my studies in France stemmed from several factors. First of all, the French language played a key role in my decision. My familiarity with the French language makes my study experience in France easier. In addition, France is renowned for the quality of its education, particularly in the sciences and mathematics, which influenced my decision to come here.

## Choosing Data Science: 
I chose to specialize in Data Science because I'm passionate about the potential of data to solve complex problems and make informed decisions. After a few years' experience, my goal is to set up my own company and become independent. Data Science offers an exciting opportunity to combine skills in mathematics, data analysis and computer science to solve real-world problems.

 # Latin square 

 A Latin square is a mathematical structure used in group theory, experimental design and other mathematical and scientific fields. It consists of a square matrix (an array of cells) containing symbols or numbers, in such a way that each symbol or number appears only once in each row and column of the matrix.

Indeed, in the group $((\mathbb{Z}/4\mathbb{Z}, +)\)$, we can clearly see that class $\bar{0}$  is the neutral element of this group. This means that when we add class 0 to any element of this group, we obtain this element unchanged.

example of Latin Square: the Sudoku game

In short, a Latin square is a mathematical structure that guarantees the absence of repeating symbols or numbers in rows and columns, making it useful in a variety of fields for organization and planning.
